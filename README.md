# Research Investigation: Impact of JL Lemma Variations â€” Delhi, India

## Advisor

Dr. Pravesh Biyani

## Description

This project involves an in-depth investigation of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma, focusing on its impact on data representation and integrity when varying the number of dimensions. The investigation utilizes Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques to classify data, evaluating the stability of these classifications under different transformation parameters. The visualizations are created using Matplotlib.

## Technology Stack

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Matplotlib**

## Project Features

- **Data Visualization:** Utilized Matplotlib to visualize how varying the number of dimensions affects data representation and integrity.
- **Classification:** Applied SVM techniques to classify data.
- **Stability Evaluation:** Evaluated the stability of classifications under different transformation parameters.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries: `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `numpy`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
